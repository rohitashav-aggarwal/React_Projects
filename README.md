React Js Learning <br>

Versions: <br>
ReactDOM v15.5.4 <br>
React v15.5.4 <br>
Node v6.2.0 <br>
NPM 3.8.9 <br>
babel-cli v6.9.0 <br>
babel-preset-react v6.5.0 <br>

I am creating this repo to develop react notes that I can reuse whenever needed. <br>

If anyone wishes to go through my notes, please follow these steps: <br>
1. All of the react foundation learning has been moved to React-Foundation package and <br>
you can follow the individual directory prefixes. From 5th package until 18th package, you can <br>
try npm run buildXX (XX = prefix) to transpile jsx to js. <br>
2. All of the react architectural learning will be created in React-Architecture package <br>
starting with webpack.
